    <h1>What is RGB?</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. These three colors make up every color you see. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Wait a minute, aren't the primary colors red, blue, and yellow? Well you're not wrong. RGB is used to represent images in electronic images such as the screen you are viewing now.</p>
        <div class="content2">
            <img src="rgbExample.png" alt="RGB example image" align="left">
            <p>RGB is represented in three values ranging from 0-255 and is displayed as "rgb(red,green,blue)"</p>
            <p>Red will be displayed as rgb(255, 0, 0)</p>
            <p>Green will be displayed as rgb(0, 255, 0)</p>
            <p>Blue will be displayed as rgb(0, 0, 255)</p>
            <p>The presence all colors or white will be represented as rgb(255, 255, 255)</p>
            <p>The absence of color, or black, will be represented as rgb(0, 0, 0)</p>
